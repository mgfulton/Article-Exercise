		<h1>THE CREATIVE LIVES: TAYLOR MCKIMENS (PLUS NEW SHOW AT THE HOLE NYC)</h1>
			
		<div class="main">
			Taylor McKimens paints the mundane in a profound way. His scenes feature the characters and artifacts of his youth in Winterhaven, California. Finding inspiration in college Taylor slowly forged his own unique style, a messy, beautiful vision of everything around him. In this episode we follow Taylor as he takes us on a fishing expedition in Brooklyn, and installs a group show for the inaugural The Hole Gallery show in New York.

			<i>The Hole</i> is proud to announce a new solo exhibition by Taylor McKimens, on display through October 11, 2015..In this tightly conceived exhibition, over twenty new paintings explore the same subject—two people’s heads—inspired by two Greek sculptures from the Metropolitan Museum. These androgynous and perplexingly blank heads are the common denominator in a diverse show where McKimens experiments boldly with formal painting aspects like color, line, volume and figure-ground relationships. Employing his traditional painting and drawing talents, and pushing past their limitations, the artist fixes his subject matter so he can experiment within these restrictions to innovate. The result is a very atypical figurative painting show that broadens how figuration can be engaged with today.

			Taylor McKimens has been known for years as a painter of “American Life”, making large and narrative paintings that feature rural tableaux, economically marginalized people, overlooked and often beautiful details of the natural world and cultural debris. He is such an evocative visual storyteller and technical draftsman that viewers may not have noticed that his paintings were getting more and more experimental in technique. Over the past few years the backgrounds have gotten abstract and hectic, colors have gone haywire as he switches color mid-brushstroke and inverts shadows and highlights, and topographical line work has proliferated to both render volumes and collapse space.
